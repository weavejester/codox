# Codox

A tool for generating API documentation from Clojure source code.

## Examples

Some examples of API docs generated by Codox in real projects:

* [Compojure](http://weavejester.github.com/compojure/)
* [Hiccup](http://weavejester.github.com/hiccup/)
* [Ring](http://ring-clojure.github.com/ring/)

## Usage

Include the following plugin in your `project.clj` file or your global
profile:

    :plugins [[codox "0.6.4"]]

Or, if you're using a version of Leiningen prior to 1.7.0:

    :dev-dependencies [[codox "0.6.4"]]

Then run:

    lein doc

This will generate API documentation in the "doc" subdirectory.

## Options

By default Codox looks for source files in the `src` subdirectory, but
you can change this by placing the following in your `project.clj`
file:

```clojure
:codox {:sources ["path/to/source"]}
```

To exclude a namespace, use the `:exclude` key:

```clojure
:codox {:exclude my.private.ns}
```

Sequences work too:

```clojure
:codox {:exclude [my.private.ns another.private.ns]
```

To include only one or more namespaces, set them with the `:include` key:

```clojure
;; Again, a single symbol or a collection are both valid
:codox {:include library.core}
:codox {:include [library.core library.io]}
```

To write output to a directory other than the default `doc` directory, use the
`:output-dir` key:

```clojure
:codox {:output-dir "doc/codox"}
```

To use a different output writer, specify the fully qualified symbol of the
writer function in the `:writer` key:

```clojure
:codox {:writer codox.writer.html/write-docs}
```

If you have the source available at a URI and would like to have links
to the function's source file in the documentation, you can set the
`:src-dir-uri` key:

```clojure
:codox {:src-dir-uri "http://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/"}
```

Note: The trailing / is no longer automatically inserted.

Some code hosting sites, such as Github, set an anchor for each line
of code. If you set the `:src-linenum-anchor-prefix project` key, the
function's "Source" link will point directly to the line of code where
the function is declared. This value should be whatever is prepended
to the raw line number in the anchors for each line; on Github this is
"L":

```clojure
:codox {:src-dir-uri "http://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/"
        :src-linenum-anchor-prefix "L"}
```

Each of these keywords can be used together, of course.

### Skipping Individual Functions

To force codox to skip an individual public var, add `:no-doc true` to the var's metadata. For example,

```clojure
;; square show up in codox...
(defn square
  "Squares the supplied number."
  [x])

;; but hidden-square won't.
(defn hidden-square
  "Squares the supplied number."
  {:no-doc true}
  [x]
  (* x x))
```
